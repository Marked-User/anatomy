# Examples

Read this when you pick the example to start from (SKILL.md, "Quick figure" and workflow step 3). Open the closest one before you start.

Nine complete examples ship with the skill. Open the closest one before you start. Each framework-free example is built with `node examples/<name>/build.mjs`, which writes a standalone HTML page next to the script; add `--light` for the light theme.

- `examples/dial-indicator/` is the smallest: a dial gauge on a stand, about 300 lines in all.
- `examples/desk-computer/` is framework-free SVG: a desk computer with a keyboard you can type on. The typed line appears on a CRT screen drawn in the plane of the case front, and the picture collapses to a line and a dot when you switch it off. It has about 85 solids and 850 paths.
- `examples/arcade-cabinet/` is an upright arcade cabinet with its side panel off, a Hero of about 240 solids and 15 cables. A quarter flies into the slot, rolls down the coin chute at the speed a rolling disc reaches on a 30° slope, trips the coin-switch wire and drops into the cash box; the switch's pulse runs chunk by chunk along its cable to the board, and the CRT warms up, self-tests and runs an attract mode drawn in the plane of the tilted monitor. The stick tilts and closes a microswitch under the panel. It shows how to place a camera so a cutaway's mechanism stays in view, a concave board drawn as a prism along any axis, moving parts rebuilt in the page from the same module the build uses, and live coins and a wire drawn in reserved slots of the settled order. `node build.mjs --audit` proves the geometry.
- `examples/raptor-engine/` is a rocket engine hanging in a test stand. Its round parts come from `kit/lathe.mjs` and its pipes and harness from `kit/tube.mjs`. It comes apart into 11 assemblies with staggered springs and per-frame depth re-sorting. Every part records its true shape, and `node build.mjs --audit` (`kit/audit.mjs`) proves, at rest, apart and in every replayed frame of the explode, that nothing passes through anything, that every end sits on a real mount, that no bend pinches, folds or lands on another line, that no curved profile's slope wobbles, and that every overlap is drawn in depth order. A WebGL plume, shock, splash and steam render between the back and front SVG. It is the reference for dense pipework, smooth shading and fades.
- `examples/ripple-tank/` is a school ripple tank on tall legs over a paper screen, seen from 44° up. Two WebGL layers (lamp light, shadows and caustics on the paper, and the water's reflections and glass) are registered to the isometric planes and driven by a pure dispersion and optics model (`model.mjs`); a frequency change travels out from the dippers through a history texture.
- `examples/test-rig/` is a production figure from a real site (React/Next): a glass button on a spring-mounted carriage, a finger probe on a rail that presses and pulls, and a dial gauge reading the lean. It has 53 solids and about 470 paths.
- `examples/spot-plate/` is a second production figure from the same site: six pairs of glass drops on a spot plate, each pair drawn from one distance field, so a pair closer than `merge` runs together into one piece of glass. A fan of feeler blades sets `merge`, one blade per gap. It is the reference for shapes that morph into each other and for one control driving many parts.
- `examples/turning-dial/` is the optional 3D mode: a combination dial that turns in true 3D with a small robot hand on it. It has about 90 live parts in metal materials, a second turn group, a hinge, a three-hinge finger that lifts and a pod that breaks off as a free body. A WebGL LED, its light pool and sparks follow the moving parts. `stress.mjs` beside it is a dense hand of about 380 parts in a cluttered workshop, used to measure performance.
- `examples/balance-ledger/` is a second small framework-free figure in the dial-indicator style: double-entry bookkeeping as a counter (Roberval) beam balance, about 370 lines. Each journal entry puts a weight sized by its dollars on the debit pan and one on the credit pan; the beam tips while an entry is half posted and comes back to level when debits equal credits, read by a pointer geared 4 to 1 over a scale, and the readout is in dollars from the same model. The beam is inside the housing, so the pans only move up and down and only the needle and the pan rods are redrawn per frame: the pattern to copy when a part would otherwise have to rotate out of the kit's vertical prisms.

The test rig is the quality bar for the drawing itself. The Raptor is the bar for shader work: a WebGL effect has to reach its standard of world-space, no-pop, seamless rendering.

## The references

Read these as you need them:

- `references/craft.md`: the look in depth, including the parts vocabulary with code, tone tables, painter's order patterns, round parts, pipes and harnesses, exploded views, screens on faces, and the anti-patterns that got figures rejected. Read it before designing.
- `references/kit.md`: the API, with signatures and examples.
- `references/motion.md`: live behaviour (loops, springs, tours, pointer, keyboard, accessibility, reduced motion), plus envelopes for one-shot events, exploded views, depth re-sorting and arming, in vanilla JS and React.
- `references/react.md`: the React/Next.js server/client split, element props and the large-payload key-warning trap.
- `references/verify.md`: the `capture.mjs` and `drive.mjs` commands, the review checklist (including shaders) and common faults.
- `references/webgl.md`: shaders inside the drawing: when one earns its place, the layer stack, the camera contract, ray-marching in the iso camera, the full API with a minimal page, the craft rules with the bugs that taught them, the light theme (inks on paper, per-phenomenon recipes, the reviewers' faults), and how to verify them.
- `references/walkthrough.md`: how the test rig was designed, step by step, from concept to code.
- `references/3d.md`: the optional 3D mode: groups and poses, live layers, convex parts and their rules, materials, free groups, hinge chains, painter's order, static clutter around a turntable, shaders that follow the turn, the orbit audit, browser checks, performance and limits.
- `references/pipes.md`: pipes, cables and turned parts: the rules, the kit files and the audit. Read it only if the figure has them.
- `references/concepts.md`: concepts mapped to the objects that explain them, including accounting and finance.
- `references/examples.md`: this page.
